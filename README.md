Our project aims at **deployment** of inexpensive hardware with camera module support in various buildings, such as residences, malls, offices, airports, etc.

More often than not, in times of disaster such as earthquakes and fires, it becomes necessary to evacuate such buildings for safety. At times like these, disaster management agencies try to ensure that no one is left behind in them. However, they have no accurate data on how many people are still stuck in these buildings. 

Options like thermal imaging are not feasible due to reasons such as unavailability and opaqueness to such instruments offered by walls. Hence, another solution is required.

Our hardware deployments are a simple fix to this problem. These devices will be placed at **all entry and exit points** of these buildings, such that **any person entering or exiting** the building is accounted for. Internally, these devices will relay data to a common server which will maintain a count of the number of people inside buildings. Hence, in case of such emergencies, it becomes a simple matter to realize whether a building has been completely evacuated or not. 

## Drawbacks: 
We have taken into consideration that people may not be willing to install custom hardware for something as improbable as a natural disaster. But the device doubles up as a security measure, as it is of importance to know the number of people currently present inside of a building. Thus, it will be relatively easy to convince people for such installations.

## Scope:  
The project may be further extended to predict regions where the number of buildings with stuck people is higher (**a disaster density**, so to speak). This will be highly beneficial in cases where the number of personnel are limited and help needs to be targeted rather than provided everywhere. This would require all these servers to provide a data outlet to the offices of the emergency services.
